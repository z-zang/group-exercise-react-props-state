    // Compare this to <ChuckJoke/> which just returns the JSX directly like this:
    // const ChuckJoke = () => <>... some JSX Here...</>;

    // Instead, this component uses curly braces `{}` and a `return` statement

    // This allows us to write code here to perform some logic before we construct 
    // the JSX we want to return

    // If you don't have any particular need to write TypeScript/JavaScript logic 
    // in a component, then it's cleaner to use the implicit return style from 
    // <ChuckJoke/>
